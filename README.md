https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x34409cfae69b786a04b5da8337dcdb0cc7be4ef04140ad9a0b8ef18342553b92

For offramp, you need to convert your asset into EURe which is an E-money for EUR. You can convert this using Uniswap Widget on our dapp. After successfull swap, you need to connect to Monerium.
You can log in to monerium using PAY with IBAN feature.

Our dapp uses Monerium for allowing users to offramp easily from their safe wallet.

You can also transfer EURe from your safe wallet to other person's IBAN using the form present in our dapp.
