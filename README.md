# PaywithGHO

Welcome to PaywithGHO, your go-to solution for streamlined payments and seamless transactions, providing an easy onramp solution. Our platform is designed to simplify the process of sending and receiving payments with GHO, while also leveraging the unique features of GHO TOKEN, such as credit delegation, over-collateralized lending, and borrowing.

## Project Overview

PaywithGHO focuses on increasing the accessibility of GHO by offering features like wrapping and streaming the token, as well as sending and borrowing from an AA wallet (safe). This abstraction and simplification enhance the overall user experience, particularly in the areas of onramp and offramp, AA wallet interaction, and GHO lending and borrowing.

## Features

### 1. Account Abstraction

Users can seamlessly interact with the AAVEV3 Pool by connecting their Google Account. The easy onboarding process provides access to their Safe ERC-4337 Account within our Dapp, allowing them to perform actions such as supplying, borrowing, and repay.

### 2. Seamless GHO Payments

Users can effortlessly send payments to each other using GHO Tokens. The process involves wrapping and streaming the GHO Tokens, providing a frictionless experience for users.

### 3. Credit Delegation

PaywithGHO supports credit delegation for users, enabling them to manage their credit effectively within the platform.

### 4. Wrapping and Streaming GHO Tokens

Users have the capability to wrap and stream GHO Tokens every minute, enhancing the flexibility and utility of the GHO Token.

### 5. Onramp and Offramp with Monerium

PaywithGHO features a seamless onramp and offramp experience powered by Monerium. Users can easily convert their assets into EURe, an E-money for EUR, using the Uniswap Widget on our Dapp. The offramp process involves connecting to Monerium, where users can utilize the "PAY with IBAN" feature for a straightforward offramp experience.

### 6. GHOx Super Token on Superfluid

PaywithGHO has deployed a wrapper token for GHO on Superfluid by creating a contract. The GHO Super Token (GHOx) has been introduced, maintaining a 1:1 ratio with the original GHO token. This innovation allows users to wrap their GHO tokens into GHOx Super Tokens and create a flow of GHO tokens every minute based on their specific requirements.

### 7. Dashboard Listing

We're proud to announce that PaywithGHO and the GHOx Super Token have been listed on the Superfluid dashboard. Check it out [here](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/assets/issues/198).

## Offramp Process

1. **Swap GHO to EURe:** Utilize the Uniswap Widget on our Dapp to swap GHO to EURe successfully.
   
2. **Connect to Monerium:** Log in to Monerium using the "PAY with IBAN" feature to access your EURe funds.

3. **Transfer EURe:** Users can transfer EURe from their Safe Wallet to another person's IBAN using the form provided in our Dapp.
